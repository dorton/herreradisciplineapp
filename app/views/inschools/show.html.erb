RE: The <%= @inschool.days %> day IN SCHOOL SUSPENSION of <%= @student.first_name %>.<br>
<br>

Dear <%= @student.parent_name %>,<br>
<br>
Your child, <%= @student.first_name %> will be suspended from class to attend in-school suspension in the office beginning on <%= @inschool.start_date.strftime("%m/%d/%Y") %> and ending on <%= @inschool.end_date.strftime("%m/%d/%Y") %> (<%= @inschool.days %> days) for violating the following in the Code of Student Conduct:<br>
<br>
<%= @inschool.reason.upcase %><br>
<br>
This misconduct has been explained to your child and has been given the opportunity to respond to these charges. I have considered reasonable alternatives to in-school suspension and determined that this action is most appropriate. <br>
<br>
You are asked to schedule a conference as soon as possible with a school administrator to discuss this violation of school policy. Any further disciplinary action will be discussed during this conference.<br>
<br>
The student will be given assignments during this in-school suspension. If you have any questions, feel free to call.<br>
<br>
<br>
Thank you,<br>
<br>
<%= @inschool.administrator %>
